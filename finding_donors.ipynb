    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea in choosing the model is to start with simple ones that might perform somewhat well on the data and move to more complicated ones (Occam's razor in action here). Also, diversity is important to make sure we are looking at the problem from different angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Decision Trees **\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are useful for [credit-scoring](http://www.knowledgetaiwan.org/ojs/index.php/ijbi/article/download/77/35), among [other applications](http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/~salzberg/docs/murthy_thesis/survey/node32.html), and are known for the ease of training on large datasets, capability of handling both numerical and categorical data, extensibility for multiclass problems, dealing with nonlinear decision boundaries and interpretability.\n",
    "The problem with decision trees is that they too much attention to the data and tend to produce very complicated decision boundaries (overfitting), specially when classes are not axis-aligned. Prunning may be employed, but it may become difficult for the prunned tree to explain the training data effectively.\n",
    "Decision Trees are a good starting point for the problem as they offer some insight into the data, are quick to train and, after hyper-parameter selection, can become good baseline models.\n",
    "This model is a good candidate for the problem because we don't have to worry about having both numeric and categorical features or even feature scaling. Also, we can inspect the model and compare with our understanding of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Random Forest **\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest have received a lot of attention in the field of [computer vision](http://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/frintrop_simone//BVW13/BVW-gall.pdf) to predict, for example, handwritten digits or facial features in a face photograph.\n",
    "Random Forests are very versatile, performing well on a variety of problems and offer a good starting point when not much is known about the data. They are able achieve balance between bias and variance by using bagging and subsetting features for each tree that is built (which reduces correlation between trees).\n",
    "Another key aspect of Random Forests is their capability of dealing with unimportant features, which turns to be a problem with Decision Trees (see above). Some even use them solely for [feature selection](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html#feature-selection-as-part-of-a-pipeline)!\n",
    "Unfortunately, they are not very interpretable: it is possible to see what features are deemed important, but that is all. Also, Random Forest will struggle with classes that are not axis-aligned (as Decision Trees do) or when the data is sparse (because of feature subsetting).\n",
    "This model is a good candidate for the problem reasons similar to those of Decision Trees (interpretability to a lesser degree) with the advantages of increased predictive power and built-in feature selection mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** K-Nearest Neighbors **\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Nearest neighbors have been used in [behavioral targeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Applications) to predict, for example, which ad is most likely to be clicked by a customer, based on previous activity of himself and others.\n",
    "Being non-parametric, K-Nearest Neighbors can represent arbitrarily complex functions and are known for its simplicity. It can deal with multiclass problems without needing any adjustment and can incorporate special domain knowledge by using a distance function tailored to the problem.\n",
    "K-NN is a lazy learner, which means that almost no effort is done until we are prompted to estimate something. This is advantageous in settings where training the model is more common than querying it, but disadvantageous in the opposite scenario. Also, K-NN does not work well in high-dimensional problems due to the Curse of Dimensionality, although we can mitigate this using by dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA.\n",
    "At a first glance, the model is not a good candidate for the problem, after all, the dimensionality may be too high due to one-hot encoded variables, but the low-dimensional embedding of the data shows some promise."
